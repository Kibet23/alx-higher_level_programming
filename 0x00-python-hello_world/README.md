#Task 1. Run inline
Write a Shell script that runs Python code.

The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

#Task 2. Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

	-Use the function print

#Task 3. Print integer

-You can find the source code here
-The output of the script should be:
	-the number, followed by Battery street,
	-followed by a new line
-You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
-Your code must be 3 lines long
-You have to use f-strings tips

#Task 4. Print float
Print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

-You can find the source code here
-The output of the program should be:
	-Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
	-followed by a new line
-You are not allowed to cast number to string
-You have to use f-strings

#Task 5. Print string
Print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

-You can find the source code here
-The output of the program should be:
	-3 times the value of str
	-followed by a new line
	-followed by the 9 first characters of str
	-followed by a new line

#Task 7. Copy - Cut - Paste
-You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
-Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
-word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
-word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
-middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

#Task 8. Create a new sentence

-You are not allowed to use string literals

#Task 9. Easter egg
Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)

#Task 10.Linked list cycle
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

	-Prototype: /**int check_cycle(listint_t *list);*/
	-Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
Requirements:
	-Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free
